# Restyle Varial Figures for Publication
---

1. Install the `cms_figure` package.

   ```bash
    ./setup.sh
   ```

2. Run the `restyle_varial.py` script. The positional command line
   arguments are the path to the Varial output directory and the
   path to the new output directory for the restyled plots.

   ```python
   python restyle_varial.py ../PlotWithVarial/my_varial_plots my_restyled_plots
   ```
